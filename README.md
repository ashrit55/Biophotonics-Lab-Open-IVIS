# Biophotonics-Lab-Open-IVIS
This is the code for the Open-IVIS system created by the HMC Biophotonics Lab. The code given when run, opens a GUI( Graphical User Interface) which allows the user to control an interchangebale amount of LED's to illuminate the box, and control the camera to create their perfect conditions. 


## Control of LED's 
  1. In the code the LED's are labeled by number
  2. You can add as many as needed!
  3. Control brightness and color to illuminate the box
     
## Control of Camera 
  1. Can change exposure time, shutter speed, and can add what needed
  2. Up to 5 pictures a time which can be displayed at show images button (can be varied)

With a modular design system, the program can be designed to take images under any lighting or camera conditions.
